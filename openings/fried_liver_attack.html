                <div class="centre-text-article">
                    <p>The Fried Liver Attack is a variation of the Two Knights Defense where white moves his knight twice and threatens a fork on the weak f7 square, protected by white's light squared bishop.</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>e4 e5</li>
                        <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
                        <li>Bc4 Nf6</li>
                        <li>Ng5</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This variation of the Two Knights Defense has been considered weak in the past, as black, with perfect play, should be able to develop faster than white in this situation. However, it can be argued that white's attack on f7 now essentially wins a pawn by force after either Kxf7 or Bxf7.</p>

                    <h1>4...d5</h1>
                    <p>This move is a natural way for black to block white's bishop and thus stop his attempt to win the f7 pawn.</p>

                    <h2>5...Na5</h2>
                    <p>This is black's most common move. After exd5, black moves his knight to the edge of the board and threatens white's bishop.</p>
                    <ol type="1" start="5">

                    <h2>6. Bb5+</h2>
                    <p>White's best response in this situation is Bb5+, attacking white's king and escaping the knight at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Black plays c6 in an attempt to dislodge white's strong light squared bishop from the b5 square and block check.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the exchange dxc6 and bxc6 are practically forced, and white is forced to either give up the b5 square or double down with Qf3, pinning the c6 pawn to black's queenside rook and prevent white's light squared bishop from being taken.</p>

                    <h1>4...Bc5 (The Traxler Counterattack/Wilkes-Barre Variation)</h1>
                    <p>The Traxler is a very interesting and sharp variation of the Fried Liver. Black completely ignores white's threats to the f7 square and instead attempts to launch a counterattack of his own.</p>
                    <ol type="1" start="4">
                        <li>Ng5 Bc5</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> If white were to play Nxf7, black can sacrifice his bishop with Bxf2+ and quickly mate white with his queen and knight.</p>
                    <p>In this situation, instead of Nxf7, white should play Bxf7+ and lead to a calmer game where white still has an edge.</p>
